Windows Firewall Technical Analysis
Firewall Architecture Overview
Windows Defender Firewall Components

Filtering Engine: Core packet inspection component
Rule Database: Storage for firewall policies and rules
Network Location Awareness: Profile-based rule application
Windows Filtering Platform (WFP): Low-level filtering framework

Rule Processing Logic
Priority and Evaluation Order

Explicit Block Rules: Take precedence over allow rules
Explicit Allow Rules: Grant specific access permissions
Default Actions: Applied when no explicit rules match
Profile Context: Rules applied based on network profile (Domain/Private/Public)

Rule Matching Criteria

Protocol Type: TCP, UDP, ICMP
Port Numbers: Source and destination ports
IP Addresses: Source and destination addresses
Application Path: Specific executable programs
Network Interface: Physical or virtual network adapters

Port 23 (Telnet) Security Analysis
Historical Context

Original Purpose: Remote terminal access protocol (RFC 854, 1983)
Security Weakness: Clear-text transmission of all data
Modern Alternative: SSH (Secure Shell) with encryption

Vulnerability Assessment
Risk Level: HIGH
Attack Vector: Network-based
Confidentiality Impact: HIGH (credential exposure)
Integrity Impact: MEDIUM (command injection)
Availability Impact: LOW (resource consumption)
Attack Scenarios

Credential Harvesting: Network sniffing to capture login credentials
Session Hijacking: Man-in-the-middle attacks on active sessions
Brute Force: Automated password guessing attempts
Lateral Movement: Using compromised credentials for network traversal

Testing Methodology Analysis
Command Execution Results
cmdC:\Windows\System32>telnet localhost 23
'telnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command
Analysis of Results

Security by Design: Windows disables Telnet client by default
Defense in Depth: Multiple layers prevent Telnet usage
Effective Testing: Demonstrates both OS and firewall security
Expected Behavior: Modern systems should block legacy protocols
